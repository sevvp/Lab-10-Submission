Challenge 1 - Steganography
--
Nick's kenny.png example involves opening the .PNG file in Notepad, and scrolling to the bottom of it to see something that stands out. In this case, what stands out is the "fmnppfpmff.." This is not any obvious encoding, but 
since the picture is of Kenny from the show South Park, the "encoding" is actually Kenny speaking because he always speaks with a muffled voice in the show, which sounds like "ppmpffpp" as well.
So, Nick google'd "Kenny Translator" which actually exists. He put in the text he found in the PNG file in the translator, and decoded the text.
Once decoded, he found that the secret text that was hidden in the PNG file was "dissolve." This was the flag in this case.

Challenge 2 - A SE Anecdote 
--
What Happened?
-
This story all started with someone that owned the Twitter handle "@N." Handles like this are always wanted because they are so simple and they
are "unique." In this case, the owner also owned a GoDaddy domain for his personal website, and that was targetted by a hacker in order to gain access to his twitter handle.
So, once the hacker got access to the GoDaddy account, they attempted to extort the owner of it for his Twitter handle since that was the hacker's goal in the first place.
Once the owner received this extortion email, they released the twitter handle "@N" so that the hacker could have it, in exchange for his GoDaddy account and an explanation of how the hacker got access to it in the first place.

How did it happen?
-
The hacker explained how he got access to the GoDaddy account once the owner of the Twitter handle gave the handle up in exchange for his GoDaddy password. 
First, the hacker called PayPal and used simple social engineering tactics to obtain the last four digits of the victim's credit card. In order to do this,
the hacker said he was an employee, and PayPal did not authenticate that in any way. Then, the hacker called GoDaddy pretending he was the victim, saying that he lost his credit card but remembered the last four so he could still verify himself.
He already had the last four of the credit card from the call with PayPal, but the real problem with this was that GoDaddy allowed the hacker to guess the last four digits as many times as he wanted to. There was no limit.
So, technically someone else can do the same thing without even knowing the last four digits, just guessing would suffice.
